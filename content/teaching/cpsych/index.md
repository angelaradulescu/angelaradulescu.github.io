abstract: At the intersection of psychology, neuroscience and AI, computational models are aimed at understanding the mechanisms underlying cognitive processes that drive behavior, and how these processes are altered in neuropsychiatric disorders. In this course, we discuss some of the goals, foundational ideas, and technical concepts behind computational modeling. We will survey several modeling approaches, including reinforcement learning, Bayesian inference and neural modeling. And we will get hands on experience with building and fitting models to data from different modalities.

summary: At the intersection of psychology, neuroscience and AI, computational models are aimed at understanding the mechanisms underlying cognitive processes that drive behavior, and how these processes are altered in neuropsychiatric disorders. In this [course](https://center-for-computational-psychiatry.github.io/course_fcp/), we discuss some of the goals, foundational ideas, and technical concepts behind computational modeling. We survey several modeling approaches, including reinforcement learning, Bayesian inference and neural modeling. And we get hands on experience with building and fitting models to data from different modalities.

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Wowchmey's [*Slides*](https://wowchemy.com/docs/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://wowchemy.com/docs/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further talk details can easily be added to this page using *Markdown* and $\rm \LaTeX$ math code. -->
